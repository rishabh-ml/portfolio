A macOS-inspired dock at the bottom of the screen to quickly jump between **Home**, **About**, **Technologies**, **Projects**, **Timeline**, and **Contact**.

### 2. Hero Section & Cursor Effects
Custom **SplitText** animation for the hero text, plus a **SplashCursor** effect that tracks the user’s mouse movements across the screen.

### 3. Animated Timeline & Pixel Cards
- **Timeline**: Showcases education and career milestones with icons.  
- **PixelCard**: Hover effects that generate shimmering pixel grids in the background.

### 4. “Spotlight” Project Cards
Hovering over a project triggers a **radial gradient** effect that centers on the cursor, making each project visually “pop.”
